Description = This mod isn't meant to be published.  It's just a mod to hold the components concerning Imoen's magic that were originally built for Transtitions.  I hope they'll be included in jastey's SoDTweaks or, better yet, I4E mod.  At some point I'd like to include her magic training in EET, i.e., dual classing her to a mage if her current class and stats permit it.  If the other components aren't included somewhere else by the time that's done, I'll probably publish this as a stand-alone mod.

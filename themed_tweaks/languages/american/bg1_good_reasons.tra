@2001	= ~Hey you!  Hurry!  Come in here!~ [%SND_SHANK%]
@2002	= ~Ye look a mite worse fer wear, <CHARNAME>. Maybe ye should go visit the clinic, get a tonic or somethin'. It's right next door.~

// Used for many different houses

// Joia gives PC RE1 book so stealing it isn't necessary
@2004	= ~I have this old book you can have.  It's all I have to give you in thanks.~

// Bently gives PC RE1 book so stealing it isn't necessary
@2005	= ~It's a right shame you got yourself attacked right outside my door.  I never!  Well here...it's not much, but I hope this helps smooth out any ruffles.~

// Bently additions
@2006	= ~You look like sturdy types that could help folks out.  There's a couple folk upstairs that need some work done, if you're interested.~
@2007	= ~That looks like Joia's ring.  I know she'd really appreciate seeing it again.  She lives in the first house you come to, on the left, when you come in through the gates.~

// Feldepost's bartender
@2008	= ~If yer lookin' to make a bit of extra coin, ol' Firebead across the street is lookin' fer this book here on "The History of the Fateful Coin".~

// All vendors
@2009	= ~I am looking for books, actually, on a rather romantic vein.  Know of any in town?~

// All vendors in Beregost
@2010	= ~Firebead probably has one, if I know that old book worm.  Other than that, the only one with a library of any size is Travenhurst Manor...northeast end of town. Could ask over there.~
@2011	= ~Do you know anyone by the name of Mirianne?  I found a message addressed to her I'd like to deliver.~
@2012	= ~Yeah, I know Mirianne.  She has a house just north of the smithy, on the east side of town.~
@2013	= ~Does this amulet look familiar to you?  I'm trying to find its owner.~

@2015	= ~I'd recognize that amulet anywhere!  It's belongs to the Colquetle family.  They have a house across the street from Feldepost's Inn, just north of old Firebead's place.~

// Firebead
@2016	= ~I've heard that you may have a book I'm looking for, actually.  A rather romantic book?~

// Travenhurst Estate (RE1 book)
@2018	= ~I heard that the library here may have a book I'm looking for, actually.  A rather romantic book?~
@2019	= ~Hey Mister Travenhurst, you got a romantic book?  This person here is looking for one.~
@2020	= ~Yes, in fact we do have one.  If they can part with 100gp, they can have it.~
@2021	= ~That's a little more than I had hoped to pay.  Perhaps I'll come back later.~
@2022	= ~Alright.  100gp it is.~
@2023	= ~I should have one, but it seems it's been stolen. You wouldn't know anything about that would you?!~
@2024	= ~No, of course not.  I'd not come here to look for it if I already had it~
@2025	= ~Ok.  Well, be off with you!~
@2026	= ~I just need the letter inside the binding.  It's for a woman who has been petrified by a basilisk for many years.~
@2027	= ~Letter...oh well, what do you know.  Sure, you can have the letter.  Here.~
@2028	= ~Ok, I'll be off then.~

// All vendors in Nashkel
@2030	= ~The only place in town with a library of any size is the Manor...northeast end of town. Could ask over there.~
@2031	= ~Does this ring look familiar to you?  I'm trying to find its owner.~
@2032	= ~Sure looks like Joseph's ring.  He and his wife have a place east side of town, just past the Belching Dragon.~

// Nashkel Manor
@2033	= ~Excuse me.  I was told you may have a book on romance in your library.~
@2034	= ~Talk to the misses about books of that sort.~
@2035	= ~Indeed, I do have one.  The illustrations are lovely.  Why?~
@2036	= ~I might be in the market to buy it if the price is right.~
@2037	= ~I'd be amenable to parting with it for, say, 150gp. It is, after all, one of my favorites and I've never seen the like again anywhere.~
@2038	= ~Alright.  150gp it is.~

// Joseph's widow
@2040	= ~I found this ring in the mines...next to a dead miner, I'm afraid.  I was told it might have belonged to your husband?~

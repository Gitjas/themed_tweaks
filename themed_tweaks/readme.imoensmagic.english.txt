GENERAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This mod isn't meant to be published.  It's just a container to hold the components concerning Imoen's magic that were originally built for Transtitions.  I hope they'll be included in jastey's SoDTweaks or, better yet, I4E mod.  At some point I'd like to include her magic training in EET, i.e., dual classing her to a mage if her current class and stats permit it.  If the other components aren't included somewhere else by the time that's done, I'll probably publish this as a stand-alone mod.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Give Imoen a wand that will cast multiple Magic Missiles for attack scene in SoD
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In case Imoen hasn't been dualed to a mage, she is given a special wand of magic missiles for her to use in the fight against Caelar's elite forces at the beginning of SoD.  The wand will be able to cast multiple magic missiles.
Requires SoD or EET

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Give Imoen the innnate ability to cast Magic Missile for attack scene in the Promenade
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In case Imoen hasn't been dualed to a mage, she is given the innate ability to cast magic missile twice at the beginning of BG2.  A potion will be provided in Chateau Irenicus for her to use to make sure she is capable of casting it when they arrive at the promenade.
Requires BG2 or EET


------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLANNED FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Add conversation about Imoen's new innate ability
* Allow for actual transition to dual-class mage from single classed Imoen during her training with Duke Liia

INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation using Project Infinity (https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/comment/1145416/#Comment_1145416) will ensure this and other mods are installed in the correct order.

NOTE: If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting a new version. To do this, uninstall all previously installed components and delete the mod folder and executables. 

When installing or uninstalling, do not close the DOS window by clicking on the X button! Instead, press the Enter key when instructed to do so.

General (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux)

Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game's main directory. 

Windows
On successful extraction, there should be a transitions folder and a setup-transitions.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-transitions.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
Run setup-transitions.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.

Mac OS X
The mod is packaged and installed with WeiDU. To install, extract the mod archive, then copy of the contents of the folder into your game folder (the folder which contains the CHITIN.KEY file). If properly extracted, you should have a "transitions" folder, setup-transitions, and setup-transitions.command in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-transitions.command and follow the instructions on screen.

Linux
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal and cd to your EET installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already run it once in the same directory. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safest bet.
Run WeInstall transitions in your game folder to install the mod. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. 

If you have installation problems or encounter any bugs, please post your bug report in the forum thread: https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/31868-transitions-mod-for-eet/.
